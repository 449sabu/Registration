### Commitment
<!-- A brief overview of the commitment you are making by joining the CSPA. -->

By submitting this PR I agree that I will fight for the full decentralization of Cardano by only running a single pool and reporting members that are breaking the rules by running multiple pools.

#### PR Checklist
<!-- A list of items to check before raising your PR. -->

I have:
- [ ] Added a telegram handle of an **individual** and not that of a group or channel.
- [ ] Added a social media account with activity.
- [ ] Removed any `@` characters from Telegram, Instagram or Twitter handles.
- [ ] Provided my operator name as my real full name, my real first name, or I have left that field blank.
- [ ] Included all social media fields in the PR even if they are blank (this will fail validation if not done).
